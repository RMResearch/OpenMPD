# OpenMPD Framework

OpenMPD is a low-level presentation engine allowing structured exploitation of any combination of MPD content (i.e., visual, tactile, audio) while dealing with the challenges specific to MPD content presentation.

For instance, our multi-rate runtime cycle allows us to combine very high computation rates for the sound-field (i.e., 10K sound-fields per second, for optimum acoustic control), with lower rates for control and rendering processes (i.e., hundreds of Hz, as typically used by rendering engines or tracking devices supporting interaction). Our low-level synchronization allows us to retain accurate interoperation among these processes, All of these enable novel capabilities, such as enabling colour projection onto high-speed particles or swept displays, as well as dexterous manipulations, such as in PoV content changing shape or precise combinations with other PoV paths.  

**It is important to notice that we are using MyBox in our examples, so please install via UPM as an additional requirement**
